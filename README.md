# Smart Contracts

This repo holds all of the BlockPass smart contract templates that are used to administer tickets and hold util functions for contracts.

The majority of these contracts will be based off templates from [OpenZeppelin](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/).

Here is a link to the [ERC-721 NFT Standard](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-721)

### Requirements
* npm

## Instructions

Since we do our smart contract development in Remix IDE you will need to select the file you want to import into Remix and edit it there. Once finished you will need to copy paste the new version to the original file on your local machine. Remix is working on the ability to open a local folder on your machine in their IDE and edit the files directly, but this is in Alpha currently.

1. Clone repo
2. Open [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/)
3. At the top of the file list in Remix, just below the workspace dropdown there are some icons. The farthest right icon should say `Load a local file into the current workspace`. Use this to import the files you want to work on.
4. Once you are done development, copy paste the changes to the original file in VS Code and proceed with regular git commands.
